# Dart/Powershell Web Scraper

A web scraper built with a flutter front end and a powershell backend. The backend is running on a small linux cloud instance. The frontend is in Flutter so that it can run on all platforms from one code base.
I built this project to learn how to interop different languages. I choose Dart & Powershell as they my strongest languages currently.
